                <p>
                    The Gridfour Virtual Raster Store (GVRS) helps Java applications manage
                    raster (grid) products in situations where the size of the data exceeds
                    what could reasonably be kept in memory. It also provides a file-based
                    API for the persistent storage of data between application sessions.</p>

                <p>Ordinarily, GVRS focuses on numerical and geophysical information.
                    Of course, there is another kind of raster data that a lot of people care
                    about: images.</p>

                <p>Recently, I used the GVRS API to support work on a project that involved aerial photographs
                    taken at high resolution over an area in central Pennsylvania.
                    The photographs were stored as images with sizes in the 100 megapixel range.
                    Rather than keeping an entire image in memory, I took advantage of the GVRS virtual
                    raster storage capabilities. Using GVRS, I was able to perform runtime image
                    processing on hefty images without consuming excessive memory.</p>

                <p>The aerial photograph project required a bit of improvisation.  The GVRS API does
                    not provide direct support for image formats. I was able to accomplish what I needed
                    to do by treating pixels as simple integers. While this solution was not ideal,
                    it produced satisfactory results. This article will describe some of the techniques I used
                    and provide background on a few concepts from image processing.</p>

                <p>One of the other goals of the Gridfour Software Project is to explore
                    techniques for lossless data compression. So having identified GVRS as a viable
                    tool for supporting image processing, I thought it would be interesting to
                    see how well GVRS would do performing data compression on image data products.
                    The results and some sample code are provided below I also discuss some of
                    the algorithmic considerations involved in using GVRS to compress image data.</p>

                <p class="blockquote"><b>Note:</b> &nbsp; &nbsp;Discussions of the GVRS data compression techniques are
                    available at <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/GridfourDocs/notes/index.html">The Gridfour Application Notes page</a>.
                    The source code for the application used for this article is available at the

                <h1 id="the_test_data">The test data</h1>
                <p>The figure below shows a down-sampled version of the source image I used
                    for the test described in this article. To fit on this page, the original 10000-by-10000 pixel image was reduced
                    by a factor of 15-to-1. The pixel spacing in the original image scale was 1 foot (0.3 meter) per pixel.
                    The paved area and structures at the lower-left corner of the image belong to University Park Airport
                    near The Pennsylvania State University. The source data was stored in a geo-referenced TIFF image
                    (e.g. a "GeoTIFF") and included metadata that would allow it to be displayed on map-based applications.

                <h1 id="processing">Processing Image Data using GVRS</h1>
                <p>One of the most common ways to represent pixels is to store them as a four-byte integer.
                    And because the GVRS API implements an integer data format, it seems a natural for storing
                    pixel values. The example code that follows uses the Apache Commons Imaging library to
                    load data from the source image and then stores it in a GVRS file. Once the data is transcribed
                    to a GVRS file, it is available for access in whatever application code or image-processing
                    implementations are desired. Although the code example omits the image-processing logic, it
                    illustrates how to set up a virtual raster data store for custom processing.</p>

                <p>If you would like a more detailed explanation of how to use the GVRS API, see the
                    <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/wiki/GVRS-Jump-Start-01_Reading-GVRS-files">GVRS Jump Start Guide</a>
                <pre>
    // Load the image and obtain its dimensions
    File input = new File("26001940pan.tif");
    BufferedImage bImage = Imaging.getBufferedImage(input);
    int width   = bImage.getWidth();
    int height  = bImage.getHeight();
    int nPixels = width * height;
    int nRows   = height; // GVRS API uses row, column as grid coordinates
    int nCols   = width;

    // Use the standard Java API to get the pixel values from the image
    // and store it in an integer array
    int[] argb = new int[width * height];
    bImage.getRGB(0, 0, width, height, argb, 0, width);

    // Create a GVRS file and transcribe the image data to the GvrsFile.
    // Here we do not specify a specific file for output, so the GVRS API
    // creates a temporary file which will be discarded when it is closed.
    // We specify a four-byte integer element named "pixel" for storing
    // pixel data, and then transcribe values from the input file into
    // the GVRS file store.
    GvrsFileSpecification fSpec    = new GvrsFileSpecification(nRows, nCols);
    GvrsElementSpecification pSpec = new GvrsElementSpecificationInt("pixel");
    fSpec.addElementSpecification(pSpec);

    // Access the GVRS file in a Java try-with-resources block
    try (GvrsFile gvrs = new GvrsFile(fSpec)) {
      gvrs.setTileCacheSize(GvrsCacheSize.Large);
      GvrsElement pixel = gvrs.getElement("pixel");
      for (int iRow = 0; iRow &lt; nRows; iRow++) {
        for (int iCol = 0; iCol &lt; nCols; iCol++) {
          int index = iRow * nCols + iCol;
          pixel.writeValueInt(iRow, iCol, argb[index]);
        }
      }
      // At this point, the image is now stored in the virtual raster data store
      // and can be used for subsequent processing.
      //     IMAGE PROCESSING CODE OMITTED.
    }catch(IOException){}
                </pre>

                <h2 id="data_compression">Data compression</h2>
                <p>The GVRS virtual raster stores data in a backing file. The example above used a temporary
                    file that was deleted when the code exited the try-with-resources block. If an application
                    needed to preserve that file from run-to-run, it could have done so by specifying an explicit
                    file reference.</p>

                <p>Of course, storing a 100 megapixel image using four-byte integers requires 400 megabytes
                    of disk space. What if we needed to reduce that? For example, if we were retaining a
                    large number of images or transmitting data across the Internet, smaller files would be better.
                    To save storage space, an application could use the GVRS API's optional data compression.</p>

                <p>The following code snippet shows how data compression is enabled using the GVRS API.
                    Note that the data compression option must  be specified as part of the GVRS file specification
                    before the output file is created.</p>

                <pre>
    fSpec.setDataCompressionEnabled(true);
    File output = new File("ExampleOutputFile.gvrs");
    try (GvrsFile gvrs = new GvrsFile(output, fSpec)) {
      // Additional code omitted
    }
                </pre>

                <p>In the current GVRS implementation, we have a number of different ways of using
                    data compression options to adjust the size of the output file.
                    In the rest of this article, we will explore three approaches:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Activate the standard data compression options supported through GVRS file settings (as shown above)</li>
                    <li>Improve data compression ratios by separating pixel values into their separate RGB values</li>
                    <li>Further improve compression ratios by mapping RGB values to an alternate color space using the YCoCg-R model</li>
                </ol>


                <p>The data-compression logic provided by GVRS is primarily suited for numerical data such
                    as temperature and elevation data. In practice, the current GVRS approach is not a great fit
                    for photographic imagery such as the Pennsylvania sample shown above. Better support for
                    imagery may be included in future versions of the API. But for now, we can still
                    get good compression results using a bit of extra code. For example, we can
                    improve data compression ratios by separating the pixel values into their RGB components
                    and storing them separately. Compressing each sequence of components individually
                    reduces the size of the output by a substantial margin. We can also gain some reduction
                    in output size by mapping the RGB components to an alternate color space based on the YCoCg-R system.<p>

                <p>We will look at these two techniques in more detail below. Before we do, let's take
                    a sneak preview of what kind of results we can expect. The table gives storage size and
                    time required to store data for two conventional image formats (JPEG and PNG) as well
                    as the three GVRS variations.</p>

                <p>While the JPEG variation is substatially smaller than all of the others, it obtains that reduction
                    by discarding low-significance detail from the source image. JPEG is a <i>lossy</i> data format.
                    Both the PNG and GVRS formats are <i>lossless</i>.
                    They faithfully preserve the full precision of the RGB values from the source image.</p>

                <p>The direct GVRS compression option does reduce the data size, but the results are
                    not as good as those of the PNG variation. Both the separated RGB components and the YCoCg-R color
                    space options reduce the data to a size smaller than PNG. But they do so at a cost.
                    The processing required for data compression increases the time to store the data</p>

                <h1 id="why_rgb">How separating RGB componets improves compression</h1>

                <p>GVRS data compression algorithms detect trends in data and use that information
                    to predict values of adjacent raster cells. Because the predicted values are generally close to
                    the actual sample values, the compressed sequence only has to account for the small differences
                    between the two. This approach reduces the amount of information that needs to be encoded
                    into the compressor's output. One of the underlying assumptions of that approach
                    is that data values represent a continuous or approximately continuous surface.</p>

                <p>Individually, the red, green, and blue components of a pixel field may fit the assumption of approximate continuity,
                    at least over subsections of an image. But packing component values for pixels into
                    an integer data type changes the numerical relationships between adjacent raster cells.</p>

                <p>The image below consists of two labeled regions, both of which are filled with a dark shade of red.
                    Their RGB values are as labeled (128, 0, 0) and (129, 0, 0).
                    So two regions vary by a single unit of intensity in their red components.
                    The two shades are so close together that they are indistinguishable on most display surfaces.</p>

                <img class="imageCentered" src="images/GVRS_ImageCompression/RGBContrast.png">

                <p>But when the individual components are packed a single integer, the numeric representation
                    exaggerates the difference in red values.  The text below shows computed differences for the RGB, binary,
                    and integer representations of the two color specifications:</p>
                <pre>
              R   G   B               Binary                    Integer

            129,  0,  0     10000001_00000000_00000000         8,454,144
          - 128,  0,  0     10000000_00000000_00000000         8,388,608
            -----------     --------------------------         ---------
              1,  0,  0     00000001_00000000_00000000            65,536
                </pre>

                <p>The packed representation obscures trends in the data and reduces the software’s ability
                    to predict values for neighboring pixels. But, by separating the components and compressing the R, G,
                    and B values separately, we bring them more in line with the way GVRS works.</p>

                <p>The code snippet below illustrates how the RGB components from the source image were
                    separated and stored in a GVRS file. The code specifies three separate GVRS elements, one for each
                    data field. These are populated and stored separately. Later, when data is read from the file they
                    can be reconstructed with some simple byte-shift operations.</p>

                <p>While the code is effective, it is a little inconvenient. Future work
                    on the GVRS library will look at ways to streamline the API when
                    working with pixel-based formats.</p>

                <h1 id="why_YCoCg">Improving compression using the YCoCg-R color space</h1>
                <p>In effect, data compression schemes reduce the storage size for a product
                    by exploiting redundancies in the content. Sometimes, though, the redundancy
                    is a data set is not immediately apparent to conventional compressors.
                    In such cases, it is possible that transforming the data to an alternate
                    form may expose redundancy that would otherwise be hidden.
                    That is exactly what is accomplished by mapping the RGB values for each pixel
                    into the YCoCg-R color space.</p>

                <p>The YCoCg-R color space was introduced in 2003 as a way of reducing
                    the size of image representations (Malvar & Sullivan, 2003). In its integer
                    form, the transformation is fully reversible. RGB can be mapped to Y, Co, and Cg
                    and YCoCg can be mapped back to the original RGB. Using integer values,
                    the transformation is defined as follows (Wikipedia, 2022): </p>
                <pre>
    // Given integer r, g, and b
    int Co = r - b;
    int tmp = b + Co/2;
    int Cg = g - tmp;
    int Y = tmp + Cg/2;

    // Given integer Y, Co, and Cg
    int tmp = Y - Cg/2;
    int g = Cg + tmp;
    int b = tmp - Co/2;
    int r = b + Co;
                </pre>

                <p>In visual terms, the Y component represents the approximate visual intensity of a pixel
                    (the term <i>gamma</i> is sometimes used to refer to pixel intensity and occassionally
                    represented by the lowercase Greek letter &#947;).
                    It has a range of values from 0 to 255 and can be stored in a single byte. The Co and Cg components
                    represent color and have a range of values from -255 to 255 and require 9 bits for storage.
                    Co is roughly related to orange (thus the letter "o" in its designation).
                    Cg is roughly related to green (thus the letter "g"). As shown in the figure below, most of the information in
                    the image is encoded into the Y component, which gives intensity values.</p>

                    <figcaption>Figure 2 &ndash; Extracted Y (left panel) and CoCg (right) components from image 26001840pan.tif.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>When the pixels from the source image were compressed using GVRS, the overall output size averaged approximately
                    9.76 bits per pixel.  The Y component averaged 4.27 bits per pixel. The Co and Cg components averaged
                    2.88 and 2.61 bits per pixel respectively. The ratios represent the relative information content and compressibility
                    of the three YCoCg color channels.</p>

                <p>The code used to store the image data in GVRS is shown below:</p>
                <pre>
    GvrsFileSpecification fSpec = new GvrsFileSpecification(nRows, nCols);
    fSpec.setDataCompressionEnabled(true);
    fSpec.addElementSpecification(new GvrsElementSpecificationInt("Y"));
    fSpec.addElementSpecification(new GvrsElementSpecificationInt("Co"));
    fSpec.addElementSpecification(new GvrsElementSpecificationInt("Cg"));

    File output3 = new File("PixelsCompYCoCg.gvrs");
    try (GvrsFile gvrs = new GvrsFile(output3, fSpec)) {
      gvrs.setTileCacheSize(GvrsCacheSize.Large);
      GvrsElement YElem  = gvrs.getElement("Y");
      GvrsElement CoElem = gvrs.getElement("Co");
      GvrsElement CgElem = gvrs.getElement("Cg");
      for (int iRow = 0; iRow &lt; nRows; iRow++) {
        for (int iCol = 0; iCol &lt; nCols; iCol++) {
          int rgb = argb[iRow * nCols + iCol];
          int r = (rgb &gt;&gt; 16) & 0xff;
          int g = (rgb &gt;&gt; 8) & 0xff;
          int b = rgb & 0xff;
          int Co  = r - b;
          int tmp = b + (Co &gt;&gt; 1);  // Co&gt;&gt;1 is equivalent to Co/2
          int Cg  = g - tmp;
          int Y   = tmp + (Cg &gt;&gt; 1);
          YElem.writeValueInt( iRow, iCol, Y);
          CoElem.writeValueInt(iRow, iCol, Co);
          CgElem.writeValueInt(iRow, iCol, Cg);
        }
      }
    }

                </pre>

                <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
                <p>This article presented results from a preliminary investigation into using GVRS to
                    process photographic imagery. While this effort barely scratches the surface of
                    the deep topic that is image processing, it demonstrates the feasible of further investigations.<p>

                <p>In future work, the Gridfour project will explore improvements to the API to make it
                    more convenient for application developers to encode image data in a GVRS file.</p>
