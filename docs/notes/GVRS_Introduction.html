                    GVRS: A Fast, File-Backed API for Managing Raster Data
                </p>



                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>The Gridfour Virtual Raster Store (GVRS) is a file-backed software module that
                    helps Java applications manage raster (grid) data in situations
                    where the size of the data exceeds what could reasonably be kept in memory.  To do so,
                    it provides utilities that allow an application to seamlessly swap blocks of the grid
                    between memory and data files. The GVRS library and file format also provide a way of
                    storing raster data in files that can be shared between applications or used
                    across multiple application runs. And, in cases where storage space or
                    transmission bandwidth is limited, GVRS provides built-in data compression
                    that can reduce storage requirements by at least a factor of four.</p>

                <p>This article gives an introduction to the Java API for GVRS. It covers some of the
                    basic ideas of the API and offers examples of how it may be used.
                    If you would like to use GVRS in your own applications, the
                    <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/wiki">Gridfour Project Wiki</a>
                    provides a "Jump Start" guide as well as other articles on both the GVRS API and
                    the Gridfour software library in general. The open-source software for the API
                    is available from the <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour">Gridfour Software Project</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Sample Data</h2>
                <p>An article that describes an API that manipulates and stores raster data
                    would surely benefit from have a good source of data to use as an example.
                    We are fortunate to have two: ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019. These products
                    give world-wide Earth surface elevations and ocean depth (bathymetry) values
                    in a regular geographic coordinate grid.</p>

                <p>In the ETOPO1 product, grid points
                    are given in a regular spacing of 1 minute of arc (e.g. 60 rows or columns for
                    each degree of latitude or longitude). Thus ETOPO1 includes
                    (360x60)x(180x60) data values, or about 233 million samples. Storing that
                    many numeric values in memory requires a lot of capacity, but is not
                    out-of-reach for a modern computer. The GEBCO product, however, uses a finer
                    resolution based on a grid spacing of 15 seconds of arc (e.g. 240 rows or
                    columns for each degree of latitude or longitude).  That spacing results in
                    a data collection containing 3.7 billion samples.  And while there are plenty
                    of computers with sufficient memory to hold that much data, it wouldn't leave
                    much room for anything else.</p>

                <h2>A Tiling Scheme</h2>
                <p>Fortunately, when dealing with such large data sets, applications seldom
                    need to access the entire collection all at once. So an obvious solution
                    to the problem of memory use is to store the data on a file and load
                    (or store) pieces of it on an as-needed basis. In essence, this approach
                    follows the pattern of a classic virtual-memory management scheme (thus the "virtual" in "Virtual Raster").
                    The Gridfour API allows applications to access cells in the grid in a seamless manner
                    using an efficient cache mechanism to provide high-speed access to data.
                </p>

                <p>The basic idea of tiling a grid can be seen in the image below. In this case,
                    a grid consisting of six rows and nine columns is divided into six 3-by-3 tiles.</p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="images/General/TilingScheme.png">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1 &ndash; A tiling scheme divides a master grid into uniformly sized sub-gribs.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In GVRS, the size of tiles are arbitrary, though all tiles must be of
                    a uniform size. Applications are free to specify tile sizes according
                    to their needs. In this case,
                    a 2-by-9 tile would have worked just fine. In fact, a 4-by-5 tile size would
                    also work, even though the tiles would not evenly divide
                    the 6-by-9 master grid. The GVRS API handles any extra cells
                    internally and their management is transparent to the application.</p>

                <p>The figure below illustrates how a tiling scheme works.  A collection of surface
                    elevation and bathymetry data could be divided into regular
                    tiles ten-degrees across. An application requiring access to
                    information in Europe would load the relevant tiles without needing
                    to access information from South America.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/PackingData/TileScheme.png">
                    <figcaption>Figure 2 &ndash; A global data set divided into 10-degree tiles.</figcaption>
                </figure>


                <p>As part of the Gridfour <i>demo</i> module, we've included an application
                    called PackageData that can be used to store the ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019 sample data sets
                    in the GVRS format. In the case of the ETOPO1 data set, the PackageData
                    demonstration application specifies a grid of 120 rows by 180 columns.
                    In terms of geographic coordinates, the product's cell spacing 1-minute-of-arc, or 1/60th of a degree.
                    So a tile size spanning 120 rows and 180 columns covers an area that's
                    2 degrees of latitude in height and 3 degrees of longitude in width.
                    This size was chosen after some experimentation because it gives a
                    good data compression results and provides a convenient size
                    for access.</p>

                <p>Tiling is a core feature of the GVRS API and deeply involved
                    in all its operations.  In fact, even a small grid is treated
                    as being tiled, though it is completely reasonable to specify
                    a tile size that matches that of the entire grid.</p>

                <p>A few other details about GVRS tiling are worth noting:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tiles can be written or read in any order.</li>
                    <li>Not all tiles in the specification need to be populated with
                        data. The overhead for empty tiles is small.</li>
                    <li>If the optional GVRS data compression logic is applied, it treats each tile as a separate
                        block of data that is compressed individually, without
                        reference to other tiles. This approach allows tiles to be written or read
                        independently according to the needs of the calling application</li>
                    <li>A key feature of the GVRS file-back API is that it maintains an
                        in-memory cache to store tiles for rapid access.  This cache works
                        to minimize file-access operations.</li>
                </ol>


                <h2>Creating a GVRS File</h2>
                <p>The GVRS library is a tool for both creating raster files and accessing them.
                    Writing a GVRS file is a 3 step process:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A specification is created giving the grid and tile size parameters.
                        Other metadata may be specified as needed.</li>
                    <li>The grid specification and a file-path specification are used to
                        create a new file for writing data. The initial file is treated as
                        an empty collection of tiles and will typically be smaller than 1 kilobyte
                        in size.</li>
                    <li>Values are added to the file one grid-point at a time. The internal
                        bookkeeping and management of tiles is mostly transparent to the
                        calling application.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The Gridfour Project Wiki includes a series of articles on reading and writing
                    data to the Gridfour Virtual Raster Store. You can find these at

                    demonstration application and other example applications in the Gridfour <i>demo</i> module.</p>

                <h3>What if you don't want to keep a GVRS file after you're done with it?</h3>
                While GVRS needs a file to support its virtual raster operations, applications do not have
                to store the file after they are finished with it. The main GvrsFile API provides a constructor
                that allows an application tell GVRS to use a temporary file.  Temporary files are removed from
                the file system when the application closes the file. See the GVRS Javadoc for more information.</p>


                <h2>Data Compression</h2>
                <p>Data compression is an interesting topic and is discussed in more
                    detail elsewhere in these notes (see
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/GridfourDocs/notes/GridfourDataCompressionAlgorithms.html">Gridfour Raster Data Compression Algorithms</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/GridfourDocs/notes/LosslessCompressionForFloatingPointData.html">Lossless Compression for Floating Point Data</a>).
                    Here, we simply note it's impact
                    on the storage for ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019 data.  In its native, uncompressed form,
                    ETOPO1 data is stored as a 4-byte integer. GEBCO_2019 is stored as
                    a 4-byte float. Both of these would require 32 bits per sample if they
                    were stored without data compression. The Gridfour library provides lossless data compression for both
                    integer and float formats. Because integer forms tend to compress better than
                    floating-point data, GEBCO data compresses better if it is converted to an
                    integer form.  In the table below, data for GEBCO is given for both
                    its native floating point format and as scaled integer.
                    GEBCO x 1 is rounded to the nearest meter, GEBCO x 2 to the nearest half meter.
                    The larger scaling factor increases the amount of information to be stored
                    in the output file, and thus the bits-per-sample values increases.</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Product</th>
                        <th>Size (bits/sample)</th>

                        <td>765.2</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>GEBCO x 1</td>
                        <td>2.605</td>
                        <td>3,732,480,000</td>
                        <td>1210.6</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>GEBCO x 2</td>
                        <td>3.1961</td>
                        <td>233,280,000</td>
                        <td>1233.0</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>Earlier, we mentioned that the storage time for the uncompressed version of ETOPO1
                    was 8.6 seconds. As the values in the table show, compressing the data requires more
                    processing and increases the time to process to 64.0 seconds. However, most data compression
                    techniques in use today require far less processing to decompress data than to compress it.
                    This generalization is also true for all the currently implemented Gridfour data compression utilities.
                    While it took over a minute to compress the ETOPO1 data, the time required to read
                    the entire 233 million points in the compressed data set was only 6.3 seconds.</p>

                <p>Even though the integer-coded GEBCO x 1 and the ETOPO1 products represent elevations with the
                    same precision (as integral meters), the bits per-sample-value for GEBCO x 1
                    is lower than that for ETOPO1. This difference occurs because
                    the sample points in the GEBCO grid are spaced closer together than those for ETOPO1
                    (15 seconds of arc versus 1 minute of arc). With the closer spacing, there
                    tends to be less variation from sample to sample, which leads to an improved
                    predictability in the data. With improved predictability, better data compression
                    ratios can be attained</p>


                <h2>Adding Supplemental Content with Metadata Records</h2>
                <p>In order to maintain a simple design, the GVRS API presents a deliberately
                    minimal feature set. Even so, we recognize that many users have application-specific
                    requirements for the product. In some cases, users may wish to attach supplemental
                    data to a GVRS file. This requirement can be met through the use of the
                    Metadata Record feature.</p>

                <p>Metadata Records are blocks of text or binary data that can be
                    stored as part of a GVRS file. The GVRS API treats these elements as <i>opaque</i> and
                    does not perform any operation related to their content. These elements may be
                    stored or retrieved using identification tags provided by the application.</p>

                <p>The ETOPO1 and GEBCO products provide an example of how this feature may be used.
                    Both data sets are based on geophysical information and, naturally, there are
                    industry standards for specifying metadata related to their content.
                    Because GVRS is intended to be a general-purpose utility,
                    adding direct support for such standards is outside its scope. However, the PackageData
                    demonstration application implements code for storing relevant metadata in a
                    GVRS file.</p>

                <p>The metadata bundled with the demonstration code is based on the <i>Well-Known Text (WKT)</i> standard
                    which is supported by many Geographic Information Systems. Well-Known Text files provide
                    information about coordinate systems (map projections), units of measure, and
                    specifications for Earth's size and shape ("datums"), and other information
                    needed to accurately represent the data on a map. While neither ETOPO1 nor GEBCO
                    supply WKT files in their distributions, both include relevant specifications on
                    their product web sites. For the demo, we used the information to create a
                    file called GlobalMSL.prj that contains metadata in WKT format.</p>

                <p>For more information about using GVRS metadata, please see our Wiki article

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The information given in this article should be enough to get you
                    started using GVRS.  The use of many of the functions described above
                    is demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/org/gridfour/demo/globalDEM/PackageData.java">PackageData.java</a>
                    application included in the Gridfour software distribution.</p>

                <p>The GVRS API is still under development. While it has undergone quite a bit of testing, it has seen
                    very little actual use. If you encounter issues using GVRS, please let us know.
                    Also, if you identify new features or enhancements you would like added to the API,
                    we welcome your suggestions.</p>
