                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>
                    The Gridfour virtual raster management system provides a way to reduce the memory required for
                    processing large and very large grid-based data sets. To do so, it divides the
					overall raster into smaller pieces (tiles) that can be swapped between memory and
					a large-capacity storage device such as a disk drive or Solid State Drive (SSD).
                    When an application requires access to a particular part of the
                    overall grid, that subsection is read into memory for processing, then discarded or written back
                    to the supporting storage system when no longer needed. This approach is similar to the classic
concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a>.
 					It represents a compromise between performance
                    and available resources. Memory provides rapid access to data, but may be limited in size 
					or needed for other uses. File-based storage is slower than memory, but provides
                    much more capacity for storing data. The Gridfour virtual raster algorithm attempts
					to balance these two considerations.</p>

                <p>Because reading and writing data to a high capacity storage device entails a substantial
				performance cost, a virtual raster system requires a mechanism for managing the
				exchange of data efficiently.  The decision of when to load or discard a particular
				subsection of the grid should be based on the patterns-of-access for the calling
				application and should attempt to minimize the frequency with which data is
				transfered between memory and backing storage.</p>

<p>In Gridfour, the exchange of raster subsections (tiles) is managed using a <i>tile-caching</i>
algorithm. Details of this algorithm are descibed below.</p>				
	 

                <h1>Concepts</h1>
                <h2>Raster data</h2>
                <p>
                    In computer programming, the term <i>raster</i> refers to any grid-based data set. There are
                    many different kinds of raster products. The most common kind of raster is a digital image.
                    A digital image is essentially a grid of data cells (pixels) each of which is assigned
                    a numerical value, usually light or color intensity codes.
                    But raster products also include mathematical objects such as matrices and geospatial grid products such as elevation data sets.

                <h2>The tiling scheme</h2>

                <p>The basic idea of tiling a grid can be seen in the image below. In this case,
                    a grid consisting of six rows and nine columns is divided into six 3-by-3 tiles.</p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="images/General/TilingScheme.png">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1 &ndash; A tiling scheme divides a master grid into uniformly sized sub-gribs.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The size of tiles are arbitrary. The GVRS API assumes that all tiles must be of
                    a uniform size, though other API's may use non-uniform specifications.
                    Applications are free to specify tile sizes according
                    to their needs. In this case,
                    a 2-by-9 tiling scheme would have worked just fine. In fact, a 4-by-5 tile size would
                    also work, even though the tiles would not evenly divide
                    the 6-by-9 master grid. The GVRS API handles any extra cells
                    internally and their management is transparent to the application.</p>

                <h2>The tile cache</h2>
                <p>
                    When an entire grid is too large to be maintained in memory, a caching mechanism may implement
                    a strategy for keeping the data that is most likely to be needed while deferring access
                    to that part of the grid that is not immediately required. The GVRS stragegy is based on the
                    assumption that when an application accesses one cell in a grid, there is a high probability
                    that the next access will be to another cell in the proximity of the first. And, in many cases,
                    the subsequent access of grid cells occur within the bounds of a single tile. This assumption
                    is often applicable whether a raster product has a spatial basis (geophysical data)
                    or not (image data, matrices).
                </p>
                <p>Following that assumption, the tile cache is organized as a priority queue orderd by
		the time of most recent access. The most recently accessed tiles are placed at the head of the queue.
		The least recently accessed are placed toward its back. The queue is configured to hold an
		arbitrary maximum number of tiles based on the desired memory use for an application. Figure 1 below shows an example
                    of a virtual raster consisting of a set of 3 rows and 3 columns of tiles. For purposes of
					illustration, the tile cache is configured to store up to 3 tiles.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="VirtualRaster_files/cache.png">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1 &ndash; A virtual raster and an empty tile cache.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The design of the cache algorithm is based on the assumption that memory is limited
                    and that there is a significant performance cost in reading a tile from the
                    associated high-capacity storage device. So the primary objective of the cache
                    is to minimize redundant access to the backing storage device and to
                    to provide a high likelihood that when a particular tile is needed,
                    it will already be in memory. To address these goals
                    the tile-cache algorithm applies the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Compute the index for the desired tile based on the grid row and column</li>
                    <li>Search the tile-cache queue to determine whether the target tile is already in the cache</li>
                    <li>If the tile is already in the cache:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Move the tile to the first position in the queue.</li>
                            <li>All other tiles are shifted to the right.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>If the tile is not in the cache:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the cache is full, discard the rightmost tile to make room for the target tile.</li>
                        <li>Read the target tile from the backing storage device (<i>i.e.</i> a file)
                            and insert at the head of the queue.</li>
                        <li>All other tiles are shifted to the right.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The figure below illustrates the state of the tile cache over the course of three 
					subsequent accesses to tiles A, B, and C.
					At the end of the sequence, the least-recently accessed tile, tile A, is shifted
					to the last (rightmost) position in the queue.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="VirtualRaster_files/cacheA.png">
                    <figcaption>Figure 2&ndash; The cache, after inserting tiles A, B, and C.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>If the application were to access tile A again, it would be moved to the head of the queue,
                    and tiles C and B would be shifted to the right. Tile B, being the least-recently accessed tile,
					would be shifted to the last position in the queue. The figure below illustrates what happens
					when the application accesses an additional tile, D. Because tile B was the least-recently
					accessed tile, it would be discarded (or written to the backing store). 
					The resulting cache would include tiles in the order D, A, and C,
					as shown in the figure below.</p>
